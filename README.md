# Titanic Survival prediction

This project uses an open-source Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster, based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and fed into a Random Forest Classifier to train a robust predictive model.

The model achieved solid accuracy and offered insights into the most influential survival factors. This project demonstrates core concepts of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification in a real-world scenario.
